## Here you can find some of the most popular design patterns implemented in Java

#### 1- Adaptor 
It is a structural design pattern which works as a bridge between two incompatible
interfaces. As the name suggests, this pattern can connect two independent and 
incompatible interfaces. A good example could be a card reader that acts as an adaptor
and connects the memory to the laptop

#### 2- Builder
Builder pattern was initially introduced to resolve some of the problems 
associated with Factory design patterns.
When the Object contains a lot of attributes, too many arguments have to be passed to
the Factory class, either actual values or null.
Builder design pattern soles this issue as it provides the constructor with 
required parameters. The rest of the properties can later be initialized through a setter.
